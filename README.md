# 15puzzle
A coursework project. </br>
This is a program for solving 15 Puzzle configurations. It is achieved by the implemented A* algorithm with a heuristic function (Manhattan Distance for now). </br>
The primary focus was to make it fast. Length of any solution produced is not taken into consideration.
